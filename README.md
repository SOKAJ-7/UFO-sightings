# UFO-sightings

## Project Overview 
The goal of this project was to design a webpage that could summarize the incidences of UFO sightings while allowing users to filter sightings based on criteria such as location, UFO shape, and date of observance. This was achieved by utilizing a dynamic table with Javascript.

## Results
Conducting a search using this table is a straight-forward process as there are only a few steps to follow which are outlined below:

For the search itself, one only needs to fill out the filter criteria in the manner shown below (Figure 1), this includes date of observation(dd/mm/yyyy), city, state, country, and shape of object observed. In Figure 1, only the city criteria was filled in but any (or none) of the fields can be filled out to determine the resulting specificity of the table.

(Figure 1)

After filling out the desired criteria, press enter and a table should load which shows the documented UFO sightings that match the provided search filters (Figure 2).

This process can be repeated for any criteria that matches entries in the database. 

## Summary
One drawback of the webpage is that search criteria is not saved. If one wants to search
